As you proceed through the rest of the book, I recommend pushing and deploying the application regularly:

$ git push
$ git push heroku
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
This provides remote backups and lets you catch any production errors as soon as possible. If you run into problems at Heroku, make sure to take a look at the production logs to try to diagnose the problem:

$ heroku logs
